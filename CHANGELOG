	- add a verify checkbox to the source page; if unchecked, don't
	  try to verify SSL certs (checked by default)
	- add UI support for the new fill-data filter
	- added support for new date_format field in clean filter
	- support reading new JSON-based input (via libhxl-python)

2016-12-02 Release 1.0
	- added support for JSON recipes via a &recipe HTTP parameter
	- add row queries for clean, count, deduplicate, replace, and
	  replace-map filters
	- use "recipe" and "step" (instead of "filters") on data recipe page
	- allow sorting filters/steps
	- allow deleting filters/steps
	- remove type selector for an already-defined filter/step
	- &force=on works for input as well as output
	- limit HTML table display to 5,000 rows to avoid timeouts (full
	  dataset still available via CSV or JSON download)
	- add a max_rows parameter to limit the number of rows returned.
	- add a /hxl-test page (available in JSON as well)
	- modify the append-filter form to add URLs on demand
	- support the new multi-URL append filter from libhxl-python

2016-08-30 Release 0.6
	- Add support for requests-cache, so that different views of the same
	  dataset won't require constant redownloading.
	- Add support for a local copy of the p-code GeoJSON shapes tree, for
	  offline demos (or other purposes).
	- Make the list of countries presented in the mapping dropdown menu
	  configurable.
	- Fix exception handling around a missing data source, to avoid
	  unpredictable behaviour (and incorrect claims of missing HXL hashtags
	  on first load from Google Drive).
	- Start adding scaffolding for jquery-sortable to rearrange filters, but
	  not supported yet in the backend.
	- Remove the sidebar (very slow to download the PNGs in a field
	  environment).
