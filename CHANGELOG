2016-08-30 Release 0.6
	- Add support for requests-cache, so that different views of the same
	  dataset won't require constant redownloading.
	- Add support for a local copy of the p-code GeoJSON shapes tree, for
	  offline demos (or other purposes).
	- Make the list of countries presented in the mapping dropdown menu
	  configurable.
	- Fix exception handling around a missing data source, to avoid
	  unpredictable behaviour (and incorrect claims of missing HXL hashtags
	  on first load from Google Drive).
	- Start adding scaffolding for jquery-sortable to rearrange filters, but
	  not supported yet in the backend.
	- Remove the sidebar (very slow to download the PNGs in a field
	  environment).
